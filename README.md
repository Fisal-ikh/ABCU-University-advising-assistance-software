# ABCU-University-advising-assistance-software
The academic advisors in the Computer Science department at ABCU are excited to see the advising assistance software moving forward. They are eager to start using the application to enhance their interactions with students.

Instructions

All coding tasks will be completed within your integrated development environment (IDE). Make sure to refer to additional resources provided in the Supporting Materials section. Your code will utilize the data structure recommended in Project One to complete the following tasks:

Input
Implement code to read the course data file. Your program, a command-line application written in C++, should prompt the user for the file name containing the course data. Read this file into course objects stored in your chosen data structure.

Menu
Create a menu that prompts the user for options. The menu should include:

Load Data Structure: Load file data into the data structure. Note that this step must be completed before printing course information or the sorted list of courses.
Print Course List: Print an alphanumeric list of all courses in the Computer Science department.
Print Course: Print the course title and prerequisites for any individual course.
Exit: Exit the program.
Loading Data Structure
Write code to load data from the file into the data structure.

Course List
Develop code to sort and print a list of courses in the Computer Science program in alphanumeric order, including all math courses. The code should:

Sort the course information alphanumerically from lowest to highest.
Print the sorted list.

QUESTIONS 
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In Project One, the problem was to analyze the run-time and memory usage of various data structures for a given set of operations. This involved implementing and testing different data structures to understand their performance characteristics.
In Project Two, the problem was to create a program that sorts and prints out a list of courses in the Computer Science program in alphanumeric order. This required implementing a sorting algorithm and handling the data structure to store and manage the course information.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached the problems by first understanding the requirements and constraints of each project. I then selected appropriate data structures based on the operations I needed to perform efficiently. Understanding data structures is crucial because they form the foundation of any program and directly impact its performance and memory usage.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I overcame roadblocks by consulting resources such as textbooks, online tutorials, and documentation. I also sought help from peers and instructors when facing challenging concepts or implementation issues.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Working on these projects has reinforced the importance of designing software with scalability and efficiency in mind. I have learned to carefully select data structures and algorithms to optimize performance and memory usage, leading to more robust and scalable programs.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This project has taught me the value of writing clean and well-documented code. I now pay more attention to naming conventions, code structure, and comments to make my code more maintainable and readable. Additionally, I have learned to design programs in a modular way, making them easier to adapt and extend in the future.
