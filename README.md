# ABCU-University-advising-assistance-software
The academic advisors in the Computer Science department at ABCU are excited to see the advising assistance software moving forward. They are eager to start using the application to enhance their interactions with students.

Instructions

All coding tasks will be completed within your integrated development environment (IDE). Make sure to refer to additional resources provided in the Supporting Materials section. Your code will utilize the data structure recommended in Project One to complete the following tasks:

Input
Implement code to read the course data file. Your program, a command-line application written in C++, should prompt the user for the file name containing the course data. Read this file into course objects stored in your chosen data structure.

Menu
Create a menu that prompts the user for options. The menu should include:

Load Data Structure: Load file data into the data structure. Note that this step must be completed before printing course information or the sorted list of courses.
Print Course List: Print an alphanumeric list of all courses in the Computer Science department.
Print Course: Print the course title and prerequisites for any individual course.
Exit: Exit the program.
Loading Data Structure
Write code to load data from the file into the data structure.

Course List
Develop code to sort and print a list of courses in the Computer Science program in alphanumeric order, including all math courses. The code should:

Sort the course information alphanumerically from lowest to highest.
Print the sorted list.
